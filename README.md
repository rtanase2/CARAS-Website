# CARAS-Website
##Description
Website created for the CARAS non-profit organization located in Gilroy, CA. Our tech stack is HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap and Ruby on Rails.

## Timeline
###July 28, Tuesday
Kick off meeting to gather requirements. Promised About Us, Contact Us, Donate and all tamale festival pages would be done in two weeks on August 18. We will attempt to edit PDF forms on the administrator side so the organization can easily download and print them for their records.
###August 15, Saturday
We have made good progress. About Us and Contact Us are done except for main content which is supposed to be provided by Reymundo from CARAS. The tamale festival pages have all been made, but need to be populated with the correct content and links.
